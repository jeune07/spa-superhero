# Overview

Many of us are superhero fans, just like me! Leveraging one of the powerful technologies for building UI interfaces, this web app aims to showcase superheroes from DC or Marvel.

**Description:**
This web app is focused on constructing a maintainable and scalable React application by employing key concepts of the React library. Users can search for a specific superhero, and if the search is successful, the app will render a card with the superhero's information. If not, an error message will be displayed. All the data is simulated from a JSON file, representing a pseudo HTTP request.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of creating the Superhero app is to showcase superheroes along with their respective information, utilizing technologies such as React.js, Bootstrap, Animate.css, Query String, and React Router Dom.
